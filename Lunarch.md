# What's Lunarch?
Lunarch is basically my Lua Obfuscator, its not fully done **yet** but it is almost done.\
This project is like 60-70% done, so im pausing my other projects for this.\
Because, i need this obfuscator. Most obfuscators i use, either they steal data or just doesn't work.\
Im trying to make it the best obfuscator out there, so stay tuned, who knows it might be release to the public tommorow;)
